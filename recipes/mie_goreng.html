    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mie Goreng (or Mee Goreng) is an Indonesian noodle dish that’s also found in Malaysia and other parts of South East Asia. With a sticky, savoury sweet sauce, noodles are tossed with chicken, prawns, vegetables and signature egg ribbons. A street food favourite!</p>
    <p>The unique thing about Mie Goreng is the sweet sticky sauce, and that there’s a good variety of “stuff” in the noodles. Though there’s no exact rules about what goes in it, the combination I’ve used in this recipe is pretty common – chicken, prawns, cabbage, bean sprouts, green onion and the signature “egg ribbons” which is simply a thin egg omelette rolled up and sliced into strips (it seriously takes less than 2 minutes to make).</p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Yellow egg noodles</li>
        <li>Eggs</li>
        <li>Leeks</li>
        <li>Protein</li>
        <li>Cabbage</li>
        <li>Tomatoes</li>
        <li>Sweet Soy Sauce</li>
        <li>Candlenuts</li>
        <li>Shallots and Garlic</li>
        <li>Sambal Ulek</li>
        <li>Cooking Oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the wok.</li>
        <li>Cook the Shrimp/Meat first. Stir fry them first and then dish out to avoid overcooking.</li>
        <li>Cook the eggs. Crack in eggs into the wok/pan and let them cook for about 10 seconds undisturbed. Then start to scramble the yolks. The eggs should be in large chunks. Dish them out</li>
        <li>Add the ground/finely chopped shallots, garlic, and candlenuts and stir fry until fragrant.</li>
        <li>Add the cabbage next. Pour some water to help soften the cabbage while stir frying it and close with the lid and let it cook for about 1 minute. Uncover the lid and add carrots and tomatoes and stir fry for another minute. If you are using leftover cooked meat (like shredded chicken for example), add it at this stage.</li>
        <li>Add noodles, shrimp, eggs and seasonings.</li>
        <li>Stir to mix everything.Make sure the seasonings are coating the noodles and everything in the wok/pan. Adjust by adding more kecap manis and soy sauce. The final taste should be savory, slightly sweet, and spicy (if using sambal oelek).</li>
        <li>Garnish with sprinkle of bawang goreng (if you like) and serve.</li>
    </ol>
